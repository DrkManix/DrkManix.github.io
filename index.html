              <p>Junction Boulevard’s culture is largely based on locals and migrants coming from different Latin American countries. It is a place where several mothers run the dynamics,
while men lay around with their Brugal bottles, listening to music from the island and playing dominos. Almost everyone talks fondly about “back in the day.”</p>
              <p>I Forgot How to Speak Spanish is a visual narrative of my childhood hometown and household in Junction Boulevard, Queens, NY. Together with a cast and crew of family, friends, and locals, I revisit familiar family routines and spaces of my family’s Dominican-American heritage. The cast is reduced into a set of stereotyped versions of themselves, with the domestic space appropriated into a eerie, hyper visual, and cinematic journey of her identity and the anxieties that come along with it. The narrative is led by the voiceover of of La Babosa, a second generation Dominican American. Her perspective is informed through notions of what is home, where does she belong, childhood nostalgia and questions of how she experiences her identity as a Dominican American.</i></p>
              <p>The film is paired together with a photographic collection of the film characters & an immersive hair installation.</p>
